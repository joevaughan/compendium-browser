# Compendium Browser
Tired of scrolling compendia? Easily browse and filter for spells, feats, items, and NPCs using Compendium Browser.

Compendium Browser is faster and better-behaved; **it no longer loads all the compendia into memory on start-up** (which sometimes hung servers because of memory or CPU requirements). Instead, it filters and loads on-demand, as well as giving you a Module Setting to control how many rows are loaded at a time.

[Patch Notes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/League-of-Foundry-Developers/compendium-browser/master/Patchnotes.md)
## v0.8:
- Compatibility with Foundry V10
- Added check for "Compendium Folders" module 'phantom' actors (#[CF_tempEntity]) to filter out of NPC list.
- Fix to handle un-migrated compendiums (they get auto-excluded from the browser even if selected)
## v0.7:
- Supports Foundry 0.8.x and Foundry 9
- Faster searches using Foundry 0.8.x queries (thanks ZoltantheDM!)
- Faster NPC searches using getIndex() (thanks kyleady!)
## v0.6: 
- Additional and Optional Features spells from Tasha's
- Spanish, German translations

## Details
Only the Gamemaster has access to the Settings, where they can enable or disable player access to the spell or npc-browser. It is **highly** recommended to disable any compendia that do not contain spell or should not be used in the NPC Browser. .

This application enables anyone to add their own custom spell or npc filters via the api. After initialization the app can be found under game.compendiumBrowser where either addSpellFilter or addNpcFilter can be used to add a filter. This does support any data that the spell or npc has, including flags.

All filters featured in the app are included in this manner and can be found in the compendium-browser.js at around line 726.
